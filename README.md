# EWOAE_algorithm

This repository provides the core JavaScript code implementing the Elevation and Water Occurrence-based (EWOAE) algorithm for recovering contaminated pixels in water classification images caused by clouds, cloud shadows, and terrain shadows.The generated dataset, namely the global reservoir monthly surface area (GRMSA) dataset, can be accessed at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16893097).



The code is intended to illustrate the main algorithmic workflow and
decision logic, rather than to serve as a fully automated software package.

## Contents
- `EWOAE_algorithm.js`: Core algorithm file implementing the EWOAE algorithm.

## Notes
- The code demonstrates the key computational steps of the algorithm.
- The code is designed to run on the [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com).
- Users may need to adapt the code to their own datasets and platforms.
